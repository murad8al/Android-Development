### dp
 Density-Independent pixels.
 A virtual pixel unit equivalent to one physical pixel on an average, “medium” density 160 dpi screen.  On higher ppi screens, dp’s are scaled to retain a constant size (px = dp * (dpi/160)).  For example, on a 200 dpi screen, the dp would take up 1.25 physical pixels.

###  Alpha
Refers to the alpha phase of the software release life cycle.  Alpha is the first phase to undergo software testing.  Alpha software can be unstable and could cause crashes or data loss.  The exception is when the alpha is available publicly (such as a pre-order bonus), in which developers normally push for stability so that their testers can test properly.  External availability of alpha software is uncommon in proprietary software.  However, open source software, in particular, often have publicly available alpha versions, often distributed as the raw source code.  The alpha phase usually ends with a feature freeze, indicating that no more features will be added to the software.  At this time, the software is said to be ‘feature complete.

---


###  Beta
The software development phase following alpha.  It generally begins when the software is feature complete.  Software in beta phase will generally have more bugs than completed software, as well as speed/performance issues.  The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts to users, often incorporating usability testing.
